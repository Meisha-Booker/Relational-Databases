# Relational-Databases

Specifications

These are the basic specs for Relational Databases, broken into 5 stages. If you complete these specs, try taking on some of the Stretch specs.

Stage 1

Setup repo, complete a Khan Academy project, and install PostgreSQL. For instructions on installing PostgreSQL, see the guides in Resources > Guides.

 [x] Artifact repo is created on GitHub.
 [x] The artifact repo is properly licensed, preferably with the MIT license.
 [x] Solution SQL for the Khan Academy project: Design a store database is added to a file in your repo named store_db.sql
 [x] SQL in store_db.sql has consistent indentation.
 [x] All the SQL keywords in store_db.sql are written in ALL CAPS.
 [x] PostgreSQL is installed on your computer with Homebrew.
Stage 2

Complete another Khan Academy project, use the SQL Designer tool, and install the Postico app (this is recommended, but not required).

 [x]Solution SQL for the Khan Academy project: Data dig is added to a file in your repo named data_dig.sql
 [x]SQL in data_dig.sql has consistent indentation.
 [x]All the SQL keywords in data_dig.sql are written in ALL CAPS.
 [x]Schema diagrams are created for both the “Store database” and “Data dig” database using the SQL Designer tool.
 [x]Screenshots of each schema diagram are added to repo as store_db_schema.png and data_dig_schema.png, respectively.
Stage 3

Create schemas and mock data for the “Music Player” app from the Init 3 goal. Then run queries against them. Read the Generating Mock Data section to learn how to generate fake data.

Music Player

 [x]Folder music-player/ exists in your repo.
 [x]Database schema SQL (using PostgreSQL syntax) for the Music Player from Init 3: Hello, Web Servers is included in the file music-player/schema.sql.
 [x]Music Player schema includes table and appropriate columns for Artists
 [x]Music Player schema includes table and appropriate columns for Albums
 [x]Music Player schema includes table and appropriate columns for Songs
 [x]Music Player schema includes table and appropriate columns for Playlists
 [x]Mock data is generated for the Music Player and added to the file music-player/mock_data.sql.
 [x]Sample queries against the Music Player database are added to the file music-player/queries.sql.
 [x]Queries against the Music Player use the WHERE keyword (at least once)
 [x]Queries against the Music Player use the LIMIT keyword (at least once)
 [x]Queries against the Music Player use the ORDER BY keyword (at least once)
 [x]Queries against the Music Player use the LIKE keyword (at least once)
 [x]Queries against the Music Player use the AND/OR keyword (at least once)
 [x]Queries against the Music Player use the HAVING keyword (at least once)
 [x]Queries against the Music Player use the IN keyword (at least once)
 [x]Queries against the Music Player use the JOIN keyword (at least once)

Stage 4
Bike Shop

Create a database for a fictional bike shop. Use the Table Schema for Bike Shop provided.

 [x]Folder bike-shop/ exists in your repo.
 [x]Database schema SQL (using PostgreSQL syntax) for the Bike Shop is included in the file bike-shop/schema.sql.
 [x]Bike Shop schema matches the specifications in Table Schema for Bike Shop.
